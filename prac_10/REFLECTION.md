# Practical 10 Reflection

## Learning Objectives
- Learn Flask web framework basics
- Create simple web applications
- Practice code review process
- Work with external APIs (Wikipedia)

## Main Learning Content

### Wikipedia API
- Used the `wikipedia` Python library
- Learned to handle API errors (DisambiguationError, PageError)
- Practiced exception handling for better user experience

### Flask Framework
- Created routes and web pages
- Used Flask decorators for URL mapping
- Built simple web applications with HTML and CSS
- Deployed application to PythonAnywhere

### Code Review
- Reviewed other students' code
- Received feedback on my own code
- Learned to provide helpful comments and suggestions

## Challenges Encountered

### Technical Issues
- **API Errors**: Had trouble handling Wikipedia API exceptions at first
- **Flask Setup**: Understanding how routes and decorators work
- **Deployment**: Configuring PythonAnywhere was confusing initially

### Collaboration Issues
- **Code Review**: Learning to give useful feedback to classmates
- **Communication**: Making sure my comments were helpful and clear

## Solutions

### Technical Solutions
- **API Documentation**: Read the Wikipedia API docs to understand error types
- **Flask Practice**: Created simple examples to understand routing
- **Deployment Guide**: Followed step-by-step instructions for PythonAnywhere

### Collaboration Solutions
- **Clear Feedback**: Made specific suggestions instead of just saying "good" or "bad"
- **Ask Questions**: Asked for clarification when I didn't understand something

## Achievements
- Successfully created a Wikipedia search program
- Built and deployed a Flask web application
- Participated in code reviews with classmates
- Learned to handle API errors properly

## Areas for Improvement
- Need more practice with Flask advanced features
- Could improve my code review skills
- Want to learn more about web development
- Should practice more with different APIs

## Conclusion
This practical helped me learn about web development with Flask and working with external APIs. The code review process was valuable for learning from others and improving my own code. I now have a better understanding of how web applications work and how to deploy them online.
